### Problem Statement :

Farmers suffering due to drought and flood, to the extent of committing
suicide, is a huge problem in India. Even though government tried and is still
trying its best to solve this problem, but clearly the problem is still unsolved
even today. A centralized trustful system to solve such problem is prone to
corruption and other unethical practices. So a decentralized trustless system
might prove to be very useful in such situation.
